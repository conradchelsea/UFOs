Using JavaScript and HTML to filter through specific UFO sighting information in 2010 and create an interactive web page to display the data.

Search criteria:

## Resources
- Data Source: Data.js
- Software: HTML, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code 1.38.1

## Summary
The analysis of the UFO sightings shows:
- All of the sighiting took place in 2010.
- There were more than 100 UFO sighitngs in the USA in 2010. 
- Over 1/3 of the sightings took place in the southwestern side of the United States. 
- The sightings lasted from minutes to over an hour in some cases. 
- The most popular "shape" was light. 

## Challenge Overview
While the subject matter is interesting, the data set was quite small. I think we would require more information to make any definitive calls about UFOs.
